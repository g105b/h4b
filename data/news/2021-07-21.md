Two potential new species in the garden today, one for certain.

Sitting in the woodland garden peering into the trees, I was of the impression (and subsequently still am) that I had seen a White-letter Hairstreak on the elm/ash merge. White-letters use elm as their larval foodplant. Shortly afterwards I had two totally unexpected but confirmed sightings of Purple Hairstreak around the ash and oak (oak being their larval foodplant). Although the Purple was an amazing surprise, the White-letter has been expected for years. I have been looking out for them all the time we have been here (24 years) as there is plenty of neighbourhood elm. In more recent years we have developed a good stand of our own maturing, flowering elm. But still no White-letters. Until today maybe. Now that would be really special: two new Hairstreak species on one day!
