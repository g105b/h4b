We are experiencing a major population explosion of Six-spot burnet moths. Since 2019 it has had record breaking years here but this year is so numerous that I have had to transfer many of them to a nearby meadow to prevent the larval foodplant - bird's-foot trefoil, also the foodplant of the Common Blue - from being decimated! We have had a high count of 87 on the 2nd of July, but the overall total is now 175 and still rising! Phenomenal for our small meadow.
