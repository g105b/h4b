# CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF A HOME FOR BUTTERFLIES

This is a chronological pictorial account of the project, that initially began as an ambitious hobby in July # 1997, but over the years has grown to be a significant conservation exercise with astounding results.

At long last nature organisations were beginning to realise that we have something to offer here: the # 2014 Green Hairstreak sighting paved the way, augmented by numbers of other species that are far more than you would expect from a garden habitat. It was designated a special wildlife site and forms part of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Boardâ€™s biodiversity plan.
