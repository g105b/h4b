BELATED REPORT OF VALEZINA SILVER-WASHED FRITILLARY

Of all the surprises we've had in the garden this year (and there have been many) the one that remained a total mystery was on the 29th July, and is described here from my diary notes..

Really surprised to not see any Silver-washed Fritillaries in the garden yet this year, even if only passing through. However, something really unusual was seen today...... The day has been poor weather-wise, and windy. As I turned into the front of a large bramble thicket in the woodland garden, I briefly saw something huge fly off from the bramble, disturbed by my presence. It was very Nymphalid like in its flight, very much like a female Silver-washed but totally the wrong colouring. It had a chequered type patterning, almost appearing greyish-white and black, but it was such a fleeting sighting and I could not find it again. I checked online for large black/white moths, and came up with nothing. Bearing in mind how my Oxfordshire 2015 unexpected sightings of Valezina initially made me think “what on earth was that?”, then perhaps a faded one would have a similar effect. I say this because of some photos I have since come across online of faded, paler Valezinas. It is only since viewing these images that I have finally decided that what I did see that day was indeed a pale Valezina form of the Silver-washed Fritillary. A few Valezinas were recorded from Lincolnshire last year so it is highly feasible.

In strong colonies between 5 and 15% of females are the variant known as Valezina. I was fortunate in 2015 to photograph the typical and Valezina forms side by side in the Bernwood forest complex. I have also included a photo of a pale specimen (courtesy of Butterfly Conservation) which is what I believe I saw.
