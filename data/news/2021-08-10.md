Following on from the 27th July update, I can now say that the Willow Emerald damselfly has a proper presence on site, it was not just the one-off sighting. We have quite a few various willows throughout the garden, and today I noticed a few damselflies close to most of them, in the nearby bushes. Hopefully it will breed with us and establish a permanent colony.

They are instantly recognisable by the iridescent green body, the white patches near the tips of each wing, and the way they hold their wings open, like butterflies.
