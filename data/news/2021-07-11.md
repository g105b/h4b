On the 11th July 2020 the new brood of Brimstones were first seen. Which means that the one seen still flying today could have lived for exactly a year as an adult butterfly. Yet, ironically on this date it almost came to a sticky end. It settled on a tall spike of purple loosestrife and was immediately pounced on by a patrolling Brown Hawker dragonfly. Somehow the Brimstone escaped its clutches and thankfully lives for another day. This is the rather ragged old timer photographed on scabious shortly afterwards.
