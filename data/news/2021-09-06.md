Yet another species to break their population records here! This time it is the Red Admiral.  The best daily count of 61 in 2019 remains the highest, but there is plenty of time left this year for the Red Admiral to beat that. Highest count yet this year is 54. However, the actual annual total has already been beaten, with the current total standing at 141 (2019 record was 129).
