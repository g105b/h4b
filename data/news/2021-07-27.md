Yesterday I had yet another of those being in the right place at the right time moments, when I stumbled across a very special damselfly that settled in front of me on the beech hedge, which is situated under a scarlet willow tree. I only had my small travel camera with me at the time and managed this shot (attached) which is not my usual standard but hopefully a decent record shot. We needed confirmation that this was indeed, as expected, a Willow Emerald, a recent UK colonist but as yet not many seen in Lincolnshire. I wrote to the recorder at the British Dragonfly Society, who is coordinating a special project to keep tracks on this incredible natural colonisation in the last few years. He replied, confirming it is a female Willow Emerald. He states that the species has only been in Lincolnshire for a couple of years, and is still quite patchily distributed; "your sighting turns out to be a new area record, so well done!"

Hopefully we will see more and get a proper picture!
