Lots of good stuff going on in the garden. The main news is the sighting of two Small Heath today. This may not sound much at all, but two is excellent in recent years (see current status for more info). We only had one in the first brood earlier this year.

It is also good to see the Brimstone doing well. It looks set to have one of its best years ever here. I saw five together on one phlox plant yesterday, I've never seen five together here before on one plant.

Another butterfly looking set to break its records is the Small Copper. Unlike its relatives the Common Blue and Brown Argus (both also having a very good year) it is more of a loner, so to see twelve together is excellent!
