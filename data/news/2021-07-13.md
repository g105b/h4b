Today I came a cross a charming aberration of the Ringlet in the garden. My eyes were drawn to this particular male Ringlet as it fluttered around the garden, and when it settled I could see why... introducing the Black-tipped Ringlet! This aberration not only has the cute black tip, but the upperside spotting is virtually absent. Underside markings are totally normal. I have included a photo of a normal male for comparison.
