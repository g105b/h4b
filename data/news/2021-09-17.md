In this record breaking year it is sad to report that one of the few butterflies that has not done very well at all is the enigmatic Comma. However, with the autumn brood now getting established, it looks like the Comma is at last making its presence felt. I saw 4 today, not great numbers, but the Comma is never found in great gatherings like the other Nymphalids. I am optimistic.
