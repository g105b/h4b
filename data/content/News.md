Well, as pleasant as the lovely June weather was, we are now back to similar weather to what we had in May: cool and wet. I'm receiving notifications form many places, even major nature reserves, that butterfly numbers are in general very low.

However, as with most things in life, there is an exception to the rule. and the exception here is the Large Skipper. This particular species has been struggling here for the last few years, worryingly so. Yet in this of  all years, it has bounced back and is experiencing its best numbers for many years, being found in all the different areas of the garden. As the photo shows, mating is taking place too.

Following the wettest and coldest May on record, the butterflies are very far behind and in low numbers. Hopefully with this lovely June weather, things will pick up soon.

Watch this space.
