I can't get over this year, butterfly wise. From all accounts it has been a rather disappointing season, very likely down to the weather conditions of April and May, plus the dreary August, and Butterfly Conservation are saying that their annual big butterfly count produced the worst numbers ever. Yet our garden has gone totally against the grain, with many species having their best year so far. Overall, it has without doubt been our most successful year to date.

The highlight has to be the unexpected discovery of Purple Hairstreak on site, which we now know for certain have bred, having recently found six overwintering eggs on oak buds, their stems being blown off in the wind.

I still have a strong inkling that amongst the Hairstreaks seen flying around the oak, ash, and elm tops, a few were White-letter but I never confirmed it. Fingers crossed!

Here is the full list of all the 2021 accolades:

**SIX-SPOT BURNET**

This day-flying moth had its third year in a row of best year to date, but this year was phenomenal, with an overall total just short of 200. They were so numerous that we had to transfer a good deal of them to a nearby large meadow, in case they ate all the foodplant, bird's-foot trefoil, shared with the Common Blue.

**ESSEX SKIPPER**

Its third best year.

**LARGE SKIPPER**

At last a much waited for return to 'normal' numbers. Its second best year.

**BRIMSTONE**

The highest count at any one time and its third best year.

**SMALL COPPER**

Its second best year to date.

**BROWN ARGUS**

Faring better than its stablemate the Common Blue, it had its third best season.

**PURPLE HAIRSTREAK**

See comments above.

**RED ADMIRAL**

Best year to date.

**SMALL TORTOISESHELL**

With only being four short of the 2003 all time best yearly total of 364, I am classing this year as its joint best year ever.

**GATEKEEPER**

Best year to date.

**SMALL HEATH**

Still low numbers but showing a dramatic return towards recolonisation.

The pair of weeping willows in the pond garden were really weeping today as they took on major damage from a sudden storm. Many large branches were snapped off - very severe pruning!

In this record breaking year it is sad to report that one of the few butterflies that has not done very well at all is the enigmatic Comma. However, with the autumn brood now getting established, it looks like the Comma is at last making its presence felt. I saw 4 today, not great numbers, but the Comma is never found in great gatherings like the other Nymphalids. I am optimistic.

BELATED REPORT OF VALEZINA SILVER-WASHED FRITILLARY

Of all the surprises we've had in the garden this year (and there have been many) the one that remained a total mystery was on the 29th July, and is described here from my diary notes..

Really surprised to not see any Silver-washed Fritillaries in the garden yet this year, even if only passing through. However, something really unusual was seen today...... The day has been poor weather-wise, and windy. As I turned into the front of a large bramble thicket in the woodland garden, I briefly saw something huge fly off from the bramble, disturbed by my presence. It was very Nymphalid like in its flight, very much like a female Silver-washed but totally the wrong colouring. It had a chequered type patterning, almost appearing greyish-white and black, but it was such a fleeting sighting and I could not find it again. I checked online for large black/white moths, and came up with nothing. Bearing in mind how my Oxfordshire 2015 unexpected sightings of Valezina initially made me think “what on earth was that?”, then perhaps a faded one would have a similar effect. I say this because of some photos I have since come across online of faded, paler Valezinas. It is only since viewing these images that I have finally decided that what I did see that day was indeed a pale Valezina form of the Silver-washed Fritillary. A few Valezinas were recorded from Lincolnshire last year so it is highly feasible.

In strong colonies between 5 and 15% of females are the variant known as Valezina. I was fortunate in 2015 to photograph the typical and Valezina forms side by side in the Bernwood forest complex. I have also included a photo of a pale specimen (courtesy of Butterfly Conservation) which is what I believe I saw.

## 6th September 2021

Yet another species to break their population records here! This time it is the Red Admiral.  The best daily count of 61 in 2019 remains the highest, but there is plenty of time left this year for the Red Admiral to beat that. Highest count yet this year is 54. However, the actual annual total has already been beaten, with the current total standing at 141 (2019 record was 129).

## 23rd August 2021

A visit to Chambers Farm Wood to see the Brown Hairstreak resulted in a much more exciting find, a Speckled Wood. But this was no ordinary Speckled Wood, it was a female aberration with much reduced markings. She stayed on Devil's-bit Scabious for a while before moving on to a low level shrub, then investigated the grasses, hopefully egg-laying. Eventually she flew up into the trees and vanished. Fortunately, Pete Smith, co-author of the new Butterflies of Lincolnshire book, was passing by and he was most enthralled by it. He later wrote on the Butterfly Conservation Lincolnshire branch website: Had a great day at Chambers Farm Wood, with Brown Hairstreak in good numbers, but the undoubted highlight was an extreme aberration of the Speckled Wood, very well spotted by Phil Bowler, who kindly drew it to the attention of myself and Adrian Royle. Almost completely lacking in markings, it was a most dramatic looking female. I am not sure what it is, but the closest I can get to an ID is that it could be a particularly extreme example of **ab.saturatior**. Failing that, we should probably name it in honour of its finder, and allocate it the name of **ab. bowlerii**!

## 20th August 2021

Well, this is proving to be an exceptional year in the garden for records being broken. Latest to add to the list is the Small Tortoiseshell , having a remarkable season just like the old days! Its previous highest daily count of 203 back in 2013  has been massively beaten by yesterday's amazing second brood count of 275, which interestingly was exactly level with the 2003 second brood total. We only need to see another four newcomers to beat the 2003 annual record (hibernators, plus first and second broods) of 364.

## 13th August 2021

Lots of good stuff going on in the garden. The main news is the sighting of two Small Heath today. This may not sound much at all, but two is excellent in recent years (see current status for more info). We only had one in the first brood earlier this year.

It is also good to see the Brimstone doing well. It looks set to have one of its best years ever here. I saw five together on one phlox plant yesterday, I've never seen five together here before on one plant.

Another butterfly looking set to break its records is the Small Copper. Unlike its relatives the Common Blue and Brown Argus (both also having a very good year) it is more of a loner, so to see twelve together is excellent!

## 10th August 2021

Following on from the 27th July update, I can now say that the Willow Emerald damselfly has a proper presence on site, it was not just the one-off sighting. We have quite a few various willows throughout the garden, and today I noticed a few damselflies close to most of them, in the nearby bushes. Hopefully it will breed with us and establish a permanent colony.

They are instantly recognisable by the iridescent green body, the white patches near the tips of each wing, and the way they hold their wings open, like butterflies.

## 8th August 2021

The Gatekeeper is having an excellent year in the garden, far surpassing its comrades the Meadow Brown and Ringlet. Numbers are easing off now but it has recorded its highest to date on site. However, I think 2004 will still retain the title of its best year due to that year having a higher daily count.

## 27th July 2021

Yesterday I had yet another of those being in the right place at the right time moments, when I stumbled across a very special damselfly that settled in front of me on the beech hedge, which is situated under a scarlet willow tree. I only had my small travel camera with me at the time and managed this shot (attached) which is not my usual standard but hopefully a decent record shot. We needed confirmation that this was indeed, as expected, a Willow Emerald, a recent UK colonist but as yet not many seen in Lincolnshire. I wrote to the recorder at the British Dragonfly Society, who is coordinating a special project to keep tracks on this incredible natural colonisation in the last few years. He replied, confirming it is a female Willow Emerald. He states that the species has only been in Lincolnshire for a couple of years, and is still quite patchily distributed; "your sighting turns out to be a new area record, so well done!"

Hopefully we will see more and get a proper picture!

## 24th July 2021

Following on from our report the other day that Purple Hairstreaks are making their home here, I am since seeing regular comings and goings high up in the trees, so you can imagine my joy when this delightful beauty dropped out of the trees right in front of me.

## 21st July 2021

Two potential new species in the garden today, one for certain.

Sitting in the woodland garden peering into the trees, I was of the impression (and subsequently still am) that I had seen a White-letter Hairstreak on the elm/ash merge. White-letters use elm as their larval foodplant. Shortly afterwards I had two totally unexpected but confirmed sightings of Purple Hairstreak around the ash and oak (oak being their larval foodplant). Although the Purple was an amazing surprise, the White-letter has been expected for years. I have been looking out for them all the time we have been here (24 years) as there is plenty of neighbourhood elm. In more recent years we have developed a good stand of our own maturing, flowering elm. But still no White-letters. Until today maybe. Now that would be really special: two new Hairstreak species on one day!

## 12th July 2021

Today I came a cross a charming aberration of the Ringlet in the garden. My eyes were drawn to this particular male Ringlet as it fluttered around the garden, and when it settled I could see why... introducing the Black-tipped Ringlet! This aberration not only has the cute black tip, but the upperside spotting is virtually absent. Underside markings are totally normal. I have included a photo of a normal male for comparison.

## 12th July 2021

We are experiencing a major population explosion of Six-spot burnet moths. Since 2019 it has had record breaking years here but this year is so numerous that I have had to transfer many of them to a nearby meadow to prevent the larval foodplant - bird's-foot trefoil, also the foodplant of the Common Blue - from being decimated! We have had a high count of 87 on the 2nd of July, but the overall total is now 175 and still rising! Phenomenal for our small meadow.

## 11th July 2021

On the 11th July 2020 the new brood of Brimstones were first seen. Which means that the one seen still flying today could have lived for exactly a year as an adult butterfly. Yet, ironically on this date it almost came to a sticky end. It settled on a tall spike of purple loosestrife and was immediately pounced on by a patrolling Brown Hawker dragonfly. Somehow the Brimstone escaped its clutches and thankfully lives for another day. This is the rather ragged old timer photographed on scabious shortly afterwards.

## 27th June 2021

Well, as pleasant as the lovely June weather was, we are now back to similar weather to what we had in May: cool and wet. I'm receiving notifications form many places, even major nature reserves, that butterfly numbers are in general very low.

However, as with most things in life, there is an exception to the rule, and the exception here is the Large Skipper. This particular species has been struggling here for the last few years, worryingly so. Yet in this of  all years, it has bounced back and is experiencing its best numbers for many years, being found in all the different areas of the garden. As the photo shows, mating is taking place too.

## 13th June 2021

Following the wettest and coldest May on record, the butterflies are very far behind and in low numbers. Hopefully with this lovely June weather, things will pick up soon.

Watch this space.
