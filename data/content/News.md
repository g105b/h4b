Following on from our report the other day that Purple Hairstreaks are making their home here, I am since seeing regular comings and goings high up in the trees, so you can imagine my joy when this delightful beauty dropped out of the trees right in front of me.

Two potential new species in the garden today, one for certain.

Sitting in the woodland garden peering into the trees, I was of the impression (and subsequently still am) that I had seen a White-letter Hairstreak on the elm/ash merge. White-letters use elm as their larval foodplant. Shortly afterwards I had two totally unexpected but confirmed sightings of Purple Hairstreak around the ash and oak (oak being their larval foodplant). Although the Purple was an amazing surprise, the White-letter has been expected for years. I have been looking out for them all the time we have been here (24 years) as there is plenty of neighbourhood elm. In more recent years we have developed a good stand of our own maturing, flowering elm. But still no White-letters. Until today maybe. Now that would be really special: two new Hairstreak species on one day!

Today I came a cross a charming aberration of the Ringlet in the garden. My eyes were drawn to this particular male Ringlet as it fluttered around the garden, and when it settled I could see why... introducing the Black-tipped Ringlet! This aberration not only has the cute black tip, but the upperside spotting is virtually absent. Underside markings are totally normal. I have included a photo of a normal male for comparison.

We are experiencing a major population explosion of Six-spot burnet moths. Since 2019 it has had record breaking years here but this year is so numerous that I have had to transfer many of them to a nearby meadow to prevent the larval foodplant - bird's-foot trefoil, also the foodplant of the Common Blue - from being decimated! We have had a high count of 87 on the 2nd of July, but the overall total is now 175 and still rising! Phenomenal for our small meadow.

On the 11th July 2020 the new brood of Brimstones were first seen. Which means that the one seen still flying today could have lived for exactly a year as an adult butterfly. Yet, ironically on this date it almost came to a sticky end. It settled on a tall spike of purple loosestrife and was immediately pounced on by a patrolling Brown Hawker dragonfly. Somehow the Brimstone escaped its clutches and thankfully lives for another day. This is the rather ragged old timer photographed on scabious shortly afterwards.

Well, as pleasant as the lovely June weather was, we are now back to similar weather to what we had in May: cool and wet. I'm receiving notifications form many places, even major nature reserves, that butterfly numbers are in general very low.

However, as with most things in life, there is an exception to the rule, and the exception here is the Large Skipper. This particular species has been struggling here for the last few years, worryingly so. Yet in this of  all years, it has bounced back and is experiencing its best numbers for many years, being found in all the different areas of the garden. As the photo shows, mating is taking place too.

## 13th June 2021

Following the wettest and coldest May on record, the butterflies are very far behind and in low numbers. Hopefully with this lovely June weather, things will pick up soon.

Watch this space.
