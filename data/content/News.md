## 20th August 2021

Well, this is proving to be an exceptional year in the garden for records being broken. Latest to add to the list is the Small Tortoiseshell , having a remarkable season just like the old days! Its previous highest daily count of 203 back in 2013  has been massively beaten by yesterday's amazing second brood count of 275, which interestingly was exactly level with the 2003 second brood total. We only need to see another four newcomers to beat the 2003 annual record (hibernators, plus first and second broods) of 364.

Lots of good stuff going on in the garden. The main news is the sighting of two Small Heath today. This may not sound much at all, but two is excellent in recent years (see current status for more info). We only had one in the first brood earlier this year.

It is also good to see the Brimstone doing well. It looks set to have one of its best years ever here. I saw five together on one phlox plant yesterday, I've never seen five together here before on one plant.

Another butterfly looking set to break its records is the Small Copper. Unlike its relatives the Common Blue and Brown Argus (both also having a very good year) it is more of a loner, so to see twelve together is excellent!

Following on from the 27th July update, I can now say that the Willow Emerald damselfly has a proper presence on site, it was not just the one-off sighting. We have quite a few various willows throughout the garden, and today I noticed a few damselflies close to most of them, in the nearby bushes. Hopefully it will breed with us and establish a permanent colony.

They are instantly recognisable by the iridescent green body, the white patches near the tips of each wing, and the way they hold their wings open, like butterflies.

## 8th August 2021

The Gatekeeper is having an excellent year in the garden, far surpassing its comrades the Meadow Brown and Ringlet. Numbers are easing off now but it has recorded its highest to date on site. However, I think 2004 will still retain the title of its best year due to that year having a higher daily count.

## 27th July 2021

Yesterday I had yet another of those being in the right place at the right time moments, when I stumbled across a very special damselfly that settled in front of me on the beech hedge, which is situated under a scarlet willow tree. I only had my small travel camera with me at the time and managed this shot (attached) which is not my usual standard but hopefully a decent record shot. We needed confirmation that this was indeed, as expected, a Willow Emerald, a recent UK colonist but as yet not many seen in Lincolnshire. I wrote to the recorder at the British Dragonfly Society, who is coordinating a special project to keep tracks on this incredible natural colonisation in the last few years. He replied, confirming it is a female Willow Emerald. He states that the species has only been in Lincolnshire for a couple of years, and is still quite patchily distributed; "your sighting turns out to be a new area record, so well done!"

Hopefully we will see more and get a proper picture!

Following on from our report the other day that Purple Hairstreaks are making their home here, I am since seeing regular comings and goings high up in the trees, so you can imagine my joy when this delightful beauty dropped out of the trees right in front of me.

## 21st July 2021

Two potential new species in the garden today, one for certain.

Sitting in the woodland garden peering into the trees, I was of the impression (and subsequently still am) that I had seen a White-letter Hairstreak on the elm/ash merge. White-letters use elm as their larval foodplant. Shortly afterwards I had two totally unexpected but confirmed sightings of Purple Hairstreak around the ash and oak (oak being their larval foodplant). Although the Purple was an amazing surprise, the White-letter has been expected for years. I have been looking out for them all the time we have been here (24 years) as there is plenty of neighbourhood elm. In more recent years we have developed a good stand of our own maturing, flowering elm. But still no White-letters. Until today maybe. Now that would be really special: two new Hairstreak species on one day!

Today I came a cross a charming aberration of the Ringlet in the garden. My eyes were drawn to this particular male Ringlet as it fluttered around the garden, and when it settled I could see why... introducing the Black-tipped Ringlet! This aberration not only has the cute black tip, but the upperside spotting is virtually absent. Underside markings are totally normal. I have included a photo of a normal male for comparison.

## 12th July 2021

We are experiencing a major population explosion of Six-spot burnet moths. Since 2019 it has had record breaking years here but this year is so numerous that I have had to transfer many of them to a nearby meadow to prevent the larval foodplant - bird's-foot trefoil, also the foodplant of the Common Blue - from being decimated! We have had a high count of 87 on the 2nd of July, but the overall total is now 175 and still rising! Phenomenal for our small meadow.

## 11th July 2021

On the 11th July 2020 the new brood of Brimstones were first seen. Which means that the one seen still flying today could have lived for exactly a year as an adult butterfly. Yet, ironically on this date it almost came to a sticky end. It settled on a tall spike of purple loosestrife and was immediately pounced on by a patrolling Brown Hawker dragonfly. Somehow the Brimstone escaped its clutches and thankfully lives for another day. This is the rather ragged old timer photographed on scabious shortly afterwards.

## 27th June 2021

Well, as pleasant as the lovely June weather was, we are now back to similar weather to what we had in May: cool and wet. I'm receiving notifications form many places, even major nature reserves, that butterfly numbers are in general very low.

However, as with most things in life, there is an exception to the rule, and the exception here is the Large Skipper. This particular species has been struggling here for the last few years, worryingly so. Yet in this of  all years, it has bounced back and is experiencing its best numbers for many years, being found in all the different areas of the garden. As the photo shows, mating is taking place too.

## 13th June 2021

Following the wettest and coldest May on record, the butterflies are very far behind and in low numbers. Hopefully with this lovely June weather, things will pick up soon.

Watch this space.
