We are Phil and Ros Bowler, and since 1997 we have created a one acre wildlife garden from scratch, devoted to the conservation of local butterflies in rural Lincolnshire. For twelve years from 1985 to 1997 we had a highly successful award-winning butterfly/wildlife garden in Derbyshire. We moved to the Lincolnshire Fens in 1997 - the habitat could not be more different: flat, with mile after mile of arable farmland, and very lacking at the time in trees and hedgerows. It was initially very uninspiring, but we had researched the area a few years prior to moving over and were aware that the waterway network of dykes were quite rich in butterflies, courtesy of their wild flower banks that were largely left alone. The local branch of the Butterfly Conservation society was very surprised when we submitted our records - they had more or less written this area off as inhospitable to most wildlife, especially butterflies. So, when we moved over, we set ourselves an even bigger challenge than before, working from a blank canvas.

Our aim was to provide the butterflies with the larval foodplants and nectar sources that they require to breed on site and expand their populations. It has very much been a success story and in recent years has been officially recognised as an important mini habitat, so much so that the Brown Argus, Essex Skipper, and the day flying Six-spot Burnet Moth have had higher counts here than anywhere else in Lincolnshire in certain years. 

The idea was that we would create an oasis of highly suitable habitat for them to colonise, so that no matter what happens in the surrounding countryside, there would always be this nucleus of suitable habitat in our garden for them: *A HOME FOR BUTTERFLIES* in fact.

The project has been supported by Butterfly Conservation and the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust. In addition, the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board's conservation and environmental initiative is working closely with us to protect and encourage the butterflies. The garden is to be included in their Biodiversity Action Plan.

How it was achieved
===================

Our garden is not just a place rich in nectar plants to entice passing butterflies, but a properly maintained and designed mini habitat for them to breed and thrive in. That was the main objective: to have them breeding here on site, as opposed to them merely visiting for nectar. In a nutshell, we needed to create an actual habitat for them - a piece of suitable countryside on our very own doorstep. 

Out of the twenty-one species currently breeding on site, we were already up to eighteen of these as early as the year 2000. A further six species of butterfly are found here less frequently, either due to their migratory status or the fact that they have yet to move in properly and make themselves at home. It doesn't happen over night. Special mention should be made here of three of these: the Green Hairstreak, White Admiral, and Silver-washed Fritillary.
