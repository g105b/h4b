# CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF A HOME FOR BUTTERFLIES

This is a chronological pictorial account of the project, that initially began as an ambitious hobby in July # 1997, but over the years has grown to be a significant conservation exercise with astounding results.

The others seen in our inaugural year were: Large Skipper, Brimstone, Large, Small and Green-veined Whites, Holly Blue, Red Admiral, Painted Lady, Small Tortoiseshell, Peacock, Comma, Gatekeeper, Meadow Brown, and Ringlet.

At long last nature organisations were beginning to realise that we have something to offer here: the # 2014 Green Hairstreak sighting paved the way, augmented by numbers of other species that are far more than you would expect from a garden habitat. It was designated a special wildlife site and forms part of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board’s biodiversity plan.

The spring butterflies did very well, as one would expect following last year’s bumper numbers in general, with the Orange Tip having its second best ever year and the Holly Blue recording its highest ever first brood numbers.

As June progressed into July though, it mostly went downhill. 2022 was indeed a year to remember, but mostly for the wrong reasons. There is heat and there is heat. And this was heat. The season was perhaps the most advanced I have ever known and that was before we succumbed to the excessive mid July temperatures, resulting in the third hottest and the driest July since 1935 despite only recording an average maximum temperature of 75ᵒF (24ᵒC). What it will really go down in the record books for is the unbearable hottest day ever recorded in the UK on the 19th July: 104.5ᵒF  (40ᵒC). The highest temperatures were actually recorded at their extreme at nearby RAF Coningsby, and ironically back in 1997 it was on the 18th July that we moved in to Windmill Lodge. This short-lived ultra heatwave resulted in desert like conditions with precious little available nectar for the adult butterflies and the all-important larval foodplants were decimated.

As with 1977, following the 1976 drought, entomologists are predicting a way below average butterfly season next year. In most habitats butterfly populations were knocked for six and presumably the incredibly low numbers of summer brood Small Tortoiseshell, Peacock, and Brimstone are down to these awful conditions at a crucial time of their development. Likewise, the second brood of the Holly Blue that did so well in the spring, never really got going. From mid July onwards the butterfly season started to grind to a premature halt, with the August countryside being more akin to October.

Following on from the unexpected arrival of the Purple Hairstreak last year, the White-letter Hairstreak has at long last followed suit. Let’s hope that both these Hairstreaks remain a very special part of our butterfly itinerary. This year has not been the best one to judge things by!

I witnessed a pristine female Silver-washed Fritillary busying herself in a non typical low level flight around the woodland garden, whereby I assumed she was seeking out violets growing near trees, so she could then lay her eggs on the said trees. I could not manage a photo but this was very encouraging to see and I am predicting that this species will be the next to become resident in our butterfly garden.

It’s not all bad news. Many species did well, albeit having their flight periods cut short, and for the second year running the Gatekeeper absolutely excelled.

Although not actually seen in our garden as such, the phenomenal huge numbers of the migratory Clouded Yellow concentrated on a nearby clover field – including the rare helice form of the female – quite simply has to be our highlight of the year. What a way to celebrate our 25 years here! Full details of this amazing experience can be found in the September blogs on the news page.
